    /// ## oneLocalHamiltonianCoefficients
    /// Array of 1-local coefficents of the objective function Hamiltonian. Assuming that a solution to a combinatorial optimization problem can be encoded into n bits (which then corresponds to an encoding into n qubits), this array must be of length n. The i-th coefficient in an array corresponds to the coefficient of a term \sigma_i^z.

    /// Array of 2-local coefficents of the objective function Hamiltonian. Assuming that a solution to a combinatorial optimization problem can be encoded into n bits (which then corresponds to an encoding into n qubits), this array must be of length n^2. The (i*n+j)-th coefficient in an array corresponds to the coefficient of a term \sigma_i^z\sigma_j^z (other coefficients in an array can take any value of type double).
